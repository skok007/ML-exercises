### 5. Unsupervised Learning - Clustering  
**File:** `5. Unsupervised Learning - Clustering.ipynb`  
**Description:**  
This notebook explores clustering techniques to group unlabeled data. It includes:  
- Implementing k-means and hierarchical clustering  
- Evaluating clusters using silhouette scores  
- Visualizing clusters in 2D and 3D  
- Interpreting clustering results in a real-world dataset

### 6. Clustering and PCA  
**File:** `6. Clustering and PCA.ipynb`  
**Description:**  
This notebook demonstrates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) along with clustering techniques. It covers:  
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA  
- Applying clustering algorithms (k-means, DBSCAN) on reduced data  
- Evaluating and visualizing clusters in lower dimensions  
- Understanding trade-offs between PCA and clustering
