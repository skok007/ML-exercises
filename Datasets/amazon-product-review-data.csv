This was Quince and Joy's Story. Quince took over the Pride after it had been corrupted by Lex. Quince was strong, loyal, charming, determined.

I laughed out loud numerous times at his tactics in getting Joy's attention. Joy was strong-willed, funny, determined, and didn't take anything off anybody. Joy and Quince had to work out their issues while dealing with some of Lex' s followers that wanted to cause trouble. By the Tail was funny, heartwarming, hot and steamy with added action.

At least until the chapter when the body is discovered. Then the author seemed to loose focus. Sam's character suddenly reveled she has mob connections and we are introduced to a group of people called the Mom Squad. They somehow play a role in solving the mystery You are also introduced to Nick's crazy aunt which sets up the second book.<br /><br />In the second book the crazy aunt has a voodoo curse go wrong and everybody including the Sherriff is running around trying to undo the curse with more magic. Which by the way the author insists on misspelling. Some part of the story are humorous but it would have benefited from a good editor. Sam's character expresses interest in learning magic (my spelling not theirs) in this book.<br /><br />Now we hit the third book in which we again find Sam's Mom squad and now we find out that Sam is related to Santa Claus and the Grams character is dating father time. We also see the return of Magic in the form of the queen of the witches. So if Sam wanted to learn more about magic why didn't she just go to this witch she already knows?<br /><br />The authors seem to be addicted the unbelievable plot twist school of writing. They also like to change voices pretty much every chapter from Nick to Sam unless they don't. Kind of like the book I couldn't really find a pattern.

Lewis’ ethical dilemma about his counter-transference experience was also very interesting and how he dealt with his struggle and guilt. But I also felt it was more than average counter-transference expereince as Lewis had a powerful crush on Lewis from his high school days. I really liked the way Josephine tactfully created Lewis’ profession so noone would be too caught up that a therapist was emotionally & sexually involved with a patient….well… Lewis was still Jasper’s therapist albeit an unregistered one but at least they took 6 month away from each other and then Lewis decided to study further (which would help him to understand more about the dynamics in a therapeutic relationship)…so I felt better as a professional…<br />I also liked the way Josephine added a little sexual intimacy without overwhelming Jasper and Lewis’ emotional journey…<br /><br />Lewis’s parents were simple adorable!!!

It's not easy to fit so much story, background, personality, passion and love in so few pages. Not only does Ms. Summers accomplish this, but she does so in spectacular fashion.<br /><br />Erin McDonald is getting through each day by putting on a happy face and acting as if she is suffering from a broken heart. For the love of god, 8 years has gone by. Is it going to stop hurting when she thinks of Jesse and how he left her behind? Probably not, especially now that he's back in town for a visit. Her body and heart seems to have forgotten that he's bad news and leads to nothing, but pain.<br /><br />Jesse Hackett has never regretted his decision to leave behind the country life for a successful career in the city. But, he's always been haunted by the loss of the love of his life. He's back in town for his mom's birthday and he wants nothing more than to rekindle the old flame. How to do that without breaking both of their hearts even more is the big question. He is only visiting and will be going back to his life in the city and he knows Erin would never follow him.<br /><br />This book is not short on heat and passion, that's for sure. The witty banter between Erin and her sister made me laugh out loud in more than one spot. Eden really is very good at sarcastic humor, which just happens to be my first language. The love between Jesse and Erin was bittersweet, yet fun to read. I highly recommend this book and any other Eden Summers story.

Shirley Jones was an actress that I admired from afar, until I read about her choices in life. To begin, the book isn't well-written. Jones frequently repeats herself, her sentence structure lacks clarity, and her use of personal pronouns is at times confusing. I could, however, forgive these distractions; after all, she's an actress and singer, not a writer. But she should have made use of a good editor or ghost writer. That said, what I found most unappealing were her vivid descriptions of her sexual mores and lascivious forays with Jack Cassidy, including a 3-way event. Not only does she make clear that Mister Cassidy was \\""very well-endowed,\\"" but she also tells us that his son was even bigger. Cassidy, as everyone knew, was an unrelenting cheat and adulterer. But this didn't seem to bother Jones much. At least, not enough to stop loving him or to leave him for many years. The Jones-Cassidy family were dysfunction because, it seems, that neither Jones nor Cassidy did what caring parents are supposed to do. Near the end of the book, Jones repeatedly attempts to justify her marriage to Marty Ingels-as she has been doing for more than 30 years. Jones claims she loved Cassidy (and still does), and that she loves Ingels. Both men, as she describes them, have serious flaws that she excuses and forgives out of hand. Unfortunately, she isn't a very sophisticated women, coming from a small town in Pennsylvania. I know that \\""Tell All\\"" autobiographies sell books, but I think Jones discredits herself in this missive. An example of this is, at the end of the book, she proudly boasts (in some detail) of still masturbating regularly at 80 years of age. As Miss Jones warns the reader early in her book, she is not the quaint, innocent young lady she flawlessly portrayed in her early films. And that's just too bad!""",2013-09-09,negative

I've never hoped for a character to come out on top, as I did Nora. She's the epitome of perfection, beauty, and brains. She has the world at her fingertips and little does she know it, men within arms reach. She may have been fed by the silver spoon, but it wasn't always skittles rainbows and fluffy unicorns. Nope! Life has been anything but wonderful for Nora. Basically she was thrown to the wolves....and by wolves I mean her wonderful family. They are wolves in sheep's clothing. Other than the wolves, I was completely intrigued with Nora's approach on life. She is ready to let go of the good girl persona, and step into the world of carelessness, fun, partying, and God knows what else. She may walk on the wild side, but sometimes life throws you a gazillion curve balls when you least expect it to....enter Leo Tate, Baby!<br /><br />Dear goodness, Leo had me wrapped around his pinky finger the moment he waltzed into my life. Not only does he have stunningly good looks, he has bad boy written all over him. So yeh he's super sexy!! And he also shines bright like a diamond, in my eyes. He is a bad boy in every which way, but holy hell he is also one of the kindest men on the planet. Oh did I mention he is also a freaking delicious Rocker Man?!?!?!?! Yeh, he is.

I loved this book, but if you're looking to this book because it's a BDSM series, you'll be a little disappointed. Maybe. Well, I hope not. But let me explain. The author starts out the book telling you exactly what you're going to get. Backstory.<br /><br />You get the backstory for the main characters in a multi-book BDSM series (the Rescue Me series). There's not much sex in this book at all. A couple of steamy scenes that are tame from a BDSM point of view and one scene that is graphic that shows one of the characters forced into sexual slavery (so it's not at all sexy).<br /><br />That said, this book is fantastically written. The characters are amazing. I loved them all. The depth they show, the real, authentic feelings, and their actions all drew me in. I will be reading every book in this series because I am so invested in these characters now.<br /><br />So buy this book. Read it. Get to know Adam, Damien, and Marc. (Also Kayla and Savi.) And then buy the rest of the books in the series.""",2013-09-09,positive

Mason is looking to refurbish this estate and move on. He needs an assistant for only 12 weeks so the job can be finished in time.<br /><br />Billie is looking for a temporary arrangement where she can make money to go to college. This job opportunity sounds almost perfect... until you factor in the chemistry they both feel.<br /><br />This story was heartwarming, sensual, and extremely sensitive to the topic of losing a child. Mason is the broken man - broken by the loss of his daughter and the dissolution of his first marriage. All he is interested in is working, keeping his mind busy so he does not have to think about his feelings, and being able to sleep at night. Although he keeps busy, his thoughts still plague him and sleep eludes him.<br /><br />Billie's influence on Mason is obvious from the very beginning of their strange arrangement. She is so full of love and empathy, she could rally anyone to happiness. I love how she handles Mason and brings him around kicking an screaming, so to speak, so he can face life, his feelings and finally become a worthy member of society.<br /><br />This book is a fantastic one day read full of entertainment.

But by 3pm Sunday I was finished.<br /><br />I love Skye, she's vulnerable and she may not know what she wants, but she does know what she doesn't want.

Skye is a girl we all have inside. She's taking the 'what if's' out of the equation. Figuring out who she is and what she really wants.

My fiancee and I scoured around 15 different jewelry shops to look for our wedding bands. I noticed that the mens' bands made from alternative metals were very good in most shops , and in the range of 250-300 dollars. That's already a huge difference from what you'd pay for a white gold or platinum ring. However, most of these alternative metal bands displayed in the shops were size 10 (the standard display size) and given that these rings couldn't be resized they told me I would have to wait 1 or 2 weeks to order them.<br /><br />That's how I started to check out rings online. All I really wanted was a clean, beveled cobalt ring. This ring by Cavalier looks just as good as those I've seen in the shops. The price is unbelievable. I prefer cobalt over tungsten because it has a brighter look that almost resembles white gold. This ring has a very nice texture and I kinda play with it often just as Gollum played with the Ring. I also quite like the fact that the only word in the inside of the ring is &#34;cobalt&#34; and none of those fancy phrases such as &#34;brute&#34; etc. or a huge brand name that you'll find in other rings.<br /><br />Please keep up the good work Cavalier Jewelers!""",2015-08-31,positive

This is my own opinion of the device.<br /><br />Overall OnHub is a pretty no nonsense type router that just works. Its super simple to setup with your phone, is fast and auto updates. I have not looked back ever since I set it up. The beauty in this router is that it gets better over time. You know what I mean if you have a ChromeBook. It auto updates and you never have to deal with firmware and security updates or adjusting settings on the device to get the optimal performance for your WiFi network. It just figures it out on its own.<br /><br />Why I love it:<br />1) Auto Updates. Probably the one of the main selling points. I have witnessed this first hand. It uses the power of the cloud to update. No security updates to apply, no firmware patches to apply, no need to plug in your laptop to set it up or flash, etc. It does it automatically through the internet.<br /><br />2) It's fast. I probably have 6-7 devices connected through WiFi and they all perform pretty well. I didn’t notice any performance differences when streaming Netflix or YouTube using the Ethernet connection or Wireless network.<br /><br />3) The Android app makes it dead simple to share your WiFi password, perform speed tests on your internet connection, see how much bandwidth devices on your network are using, and updated your typical settings you see in a WiFi router. The added bonus is you can even do it from anywhere you have a internet connection. No need to be on your home network. The default settings worked straight out of the box beautifully. (There is an iOS app, which has similar features)<br /><br />4) There are 2.4GHz and 5GHz antennas which should cover all your devices. The interesting bit for me, was that you only need one SSID for both frequencies. There is no concept of network-name and network-name-5g if you have a used a router in the past that broadcasted both frequencies. It will automatically figure out which is the better frequency for you and use that.<br /><br />5) No administrator password to remember or gateway ip to remember to update settings. You control everything through your phone, including adding additional managers to administer the device. Although, I haven’t actually had the need to use this, it might come in handy to help a friend or family member if they had some questions.<br /><br />6) It looks nice enough that I don’t need to hide it in my TV stand and can leave it out in the open.<br /><br />Why you may not like it:<br />1) The OnHub only has 1 Ethernet port, where as my old router had 4. While I thought I would miss this early on, I actually found that connecting all my devices via WiFi just seemed so much simpler and cleaner. If you need more ports for wired internet access, you will need a switch.<br /><br />2) There is no web interface to administrate the device, but I didn’t really miss it. Well, okay I will admit I did at first, since I was so use to it from my old access point. After the initial setup though, you don’t really need to touch any settings. As I mentioned before, you control everything through your phone, if you need to change anything or check the status.<br /><br />Future Wish List:<br />There is a pretty nice looking speaker on top that I heard during setup. It would be cool if this could be used in some other ways, other than just for setup. Maybe a future update?use that. 5) No administrator password to remember or gateway ip to remember to update settings.

The wireless network still exists but all devices attached show no internet connection. The same happens for any devices connected via Ethernet through the router.

Enter the Seagate 2TB drive. Now I can have that feeling again of, &#34;There, now I'll never have to worry about storage again.&#34;<br /><br />This Seagate game drive seems to be a pretty typical 2TB hard drive, priced similar to other 2TB drives, but with officially licensed Xbox One or Xbox 360 compatibility and design. When you consider the basic Xbox One 500GB console is currently priced around $350 and the newer 1 TB model is about $400, you could get the 500GB model and one of these drives (currently $100) and spend about $450 and have a total of 2.5 TB of storage. Basically, an extra 1.5 TB for an extra $50, which isn't a bad deal. Of course, you have to consider your current usage and potential future storage needs.<br /><br />The main thing I think it lacks is a little more in the way of instructions for transferring data from the console to the drive. While it wasn't that difficult for me to figure out, it might be a little more challenging for a parent who is not as up to speed on how these work. Especially considering it is an officially licensed Xbox product, it was surprising there was little more than a short pamphlet describing the drive's features included. I wish it would have gone into more detail about how it handles in-game DLC licensing content vs game content. It was not the most user friendly in that regard. I finished transferring data and wasn't positive if I was going to be able to play with DLC once it was moved to the drive (I was). A little more clarity in what it would and would not transfer would have been helpful as well as explanation on what you need to do if you use it on an Xbox 360, then upgrade to the Xbox One. I plan to do this in a few weeks, so I mayupdate the review if I hit any other snags in that process.""",2015-08-31,positive

And after another 10 or 20 pages, I was sure. And I was right. So much for suspense. The best I could say about this book is that it is okay. Just barely. It's a long book -- unnecessarily long -- and when the author hasn't taken the trouble to craft her plot in a suspenseful way, there's not a lot there to make you want to turn the page. I have mixed feelings about her main character, who was supposed to have been a vibrant, energetic, assertive woman, yet became weak and submissive to her manipulative husband. It's hard for any reader to identiify with that. Additionally, the romance in the book isn't all that interesting -- just two people who are attracted to each other. No real getting-to-know-you development, no build-up of heat, no surprise, really. This 500-page book is really 250 pages too long and it all feels stretched out, with long sequences of unnecessary dialogue, superfluous scenes to establish things that already have been established, and so on. Can't help wondering what's going on with Nora Roberts these days. She's written a number of really good books, but her recent books seem like &#34;Nora Roberts diluted&#34;. So-so, at best. Maybe with so many books behind her, she's just burning out. As far as this one goes, I'm glad I got it from the library. If I had paid for it, I'd have been steamed. Maybe if she wrote fewer books each year -- but better ones -- I'd be a happier reader.""",2015-08-31,negative

As a medical student, I concur with the other reviews that this is an excellent introductory resource to obtain foundation for your clinical education.<br /><br />This review will instead focus on the lecture videos, which supplement each and every chapter, and can be easily overlooked - and let me tell you, they are great! As someone with experience in designing and producing interactive educational multimedia, here are my takes on the videos:<br /><br />- There is a video lecture that supplements each chapter. They are very nice summaries and place emphasis on the important points in the text while supplementing with interesting points to enhance memorization<br />- There are multiple choice questions immbedded between sections of each lecture, which are great reminders and pointers of key learning points and forced you to think again. Each question comes with a full explanation of choices and main concept.<br />- The videos are short and sweet<br />- They have very similar content to the text, but uses different sensory modalities (i.e. graphs, animations, images, audio) that enhance memorization; for example, for the introductory lecture on the history of anesthesia, the pictures of different historic figures and instruments really helped me link names to events.<br />- As someone with experience in designing and producing educational multimedia projects, I understand how hard it is to have high quality (and actually very useful) digital contents made available to supplement the text. There are inherent restrictions on the different technical parameters allowed by such web contents, such as the definitions and smoothness of the videos. With that in mind, the qualities of the lecture videos are pretty great. The other thing is, while you can switch the slides and lecturer windows, it might be helpful to have an option to change the sizes of different windows (I personally think the lecturer's window is too small).<br/>- I could recommend several good ways to utilize the lecture videos. 1. you can watch the videos after reading the text 2. you can watch the video first, and then you can pause and refer back to the text for clarification if needed - the videos cover the main points. 3. read the text of every chapter, then when reviewing the concepts at the end of your study, use the lecture videos.<br /><br />In summary, great videos! And if you bought this book or planning on getting this book (yes you will like it if you are a medical student learning anesthesia or a resident looking to lay down good foundational knowledge), make sure you USE these wonderful interactive digital contents!""",2015-08-31,positive

He is a keen observer, a consumer of origins, fine distinctions, continua, grand schemes, and minute details. He likely began observing and contemplating information from the moment he experienced the glare of light in the delivery room, and he has never stopped. Interestingly, while THE MIND is about the remarkable way John thinks, it speaks to the larger questions of how we all think, how we came to be sapient in the first place, and how we develop as thinking souls in space and time. Keeping the language of his prose-like tercets basic, unadorned, and free-flowing, he accomplishes poetry of significance and elemental beauty. Left brain contemplation of structure and systems aligns itself with right brain wonder and whimsy, but neither hemisphere dominates in the work, so the reader can only expect the unexpected. And the rewards are great: poems of curiosity, orientation with the universe, sorrow, finding center, and surprising hilarity. (Only John can make the idea of rocks funny.) If I were teaching from John's book, I would encourage poetry students to examine his masterful skill with personification. I would encourage philosophy students to wrestle with his experiences of phenomena. I would ask psychology and neuro-biology candidates to experience the brain from inside-out. I would ask physics students to explore how we process space and time in an era when such concepts are continually challenged and updated. I would ask divinity students to consider creation from the point of view of the created. THE MIND weighs so many approaches to thinking and being that you won't devour it in one or two sittings. Read it as you would the Book of Genesis, or Hawking, or an introduction to meditation. You will not think the same way ever again after reading it.""",2015-08-31,positive
